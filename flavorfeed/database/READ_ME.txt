To create node app:

mkdir node-app (i put this in the same folder as my database folder in ByteSizeBrunchers)
cd node-app

npm init -y

npm install postgres

node app.js (be sure to change credentials if necessary in the code)

feel free to change the code in app.js to whatever SQL functions you need
as of now, app.js will list all data in the users table
