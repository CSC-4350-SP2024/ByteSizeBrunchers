    """Spaghetti Carbonara
Ingredients:

    1 lb spaghetti
    1/2 lb pancetta or bacon, diced
    4 large eggs
    1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
    Black pepper to taste

Steps:

    Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
    In a large skillet, cook the pancetta or bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove from heat.
    In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano, and black pepper.
    Add the hot, drained spaghetti to the egg mixture and toss quickly to coat the pasta. Add some reserved pasta water if needed to achieve a creamy consistency.
    Add the pancetta or bacon and toss to combine. Serve immediately.

Notes:

    The heat from the pasta cooks the eggs, so it's important to work quickly and not let the eggs scramble.
    Adjust the amount of reserved pasta water to achieve your desired sauce consistency.

    """Mushroom Risotto
Ingredients:

    6 cups vegetable or chicken stock
    2 tbsp olive oil
    1 onion, diced
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
    1/2 cup dry white wine
    1 lb mixed mushrooms (such as shiitake, cremini, and oyster), sliced
    1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Steps:

    In a saucepan, heat the stock and keep it at a simmer.
    In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
    Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.
    Add the Arborio rice and stir to coat the grains with oil. Toast the rice for 2-3 minutes, or until it becomes slightly translucent.
    Pour in the white wine and stir until the wine is absorbed.
    Begin adding the hot stock to the rice, one ladleful at a time. Stir constantly and allow each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. Continue this process until the rice is tender and creamy, about 20-25 minutes.
    In a separate skillet, saut√© the sliced mushrooms until they release their liquid and become tender.
    Stir the cooked mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, and butter into the risotto. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley.

Notes:

    Constant stirring is essential for a creamy risotto, as it helps release the starch from the rice.

    For a softer, chewier cookie, reduce the baking time by 1-2 minutes.
    Experiment with different types of chocolate chips, such as milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate.
    Cookie dough can be frozen for up to 3 months. Simply scoop the dough onto baking sheets, freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer bag. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an additional 1-2 minutes.
